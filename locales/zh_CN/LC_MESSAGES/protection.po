"Password protecting a workbook or worksheet only provides a quite basic "
"level of security. The data is not encrypted, so can be modified by any "
"number of freely available tools. In fact the specification states: "
"\"Worksheet or workbook element protection should not be confused with "
"file security. It is meant to make your workbook safe from unintentional "
"modification, and cannot protect it from malicious modification.\""

"Openpyxl provides support for protecting a workbook and worksheet from "
"modification. The Open XML \"Legacy Password Hash Algorithm\" is used to "
"generate hashed password values unless another algorithm is explicitly "
"configured."

"To prevent other users from viewing hidden worksheets, adding, moving, "
"deleting, or hiding worksheets, and renaming worksheets, you can protect "
"the structure of your workbook with a password. The password can be set "
"using the "
":func:`openpyxl.workbook.protection.WorkbookProtection.workbookPassword` "
"property ::"

"Similarly removing change tracking and change history from a shared "

"Various aspects of a worksheet can also be locked by setting attributes "
