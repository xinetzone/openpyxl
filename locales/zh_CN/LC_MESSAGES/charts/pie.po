"the percentage of the whole. Slices are plotted in a clockwise direction "
"with 0Â° being at the top of the circle. Pie charts can only take a single"

"Projected pie charts extract some slices from a pie chart and project "
"them into a second pie or bar chart. This is useful when there are "
"several smaller items in the data series. The chart can be split "
"according to percent, val(ue) or pos(ition). If nothing is set then the "
"application decides which to use. In addition custom splits can be "
"defined."
