"In some cases such as the one shown, setting the axis limits is "
"effectively equivalent to displaying a sub-range of the data. For large "
"datasets, rendering of scatter plots (and possibly others) will be much "
"faster when using subsets of the data rather than axis limits in both "
"Excel and Open/Libre Office."

"The first four charts show the same data unscaled, scaled logarithmically"
" in each axis and in both axes, with the logarithm base set to 10. The "
"final chart shows the same data with both axes scaled, but the base of "
