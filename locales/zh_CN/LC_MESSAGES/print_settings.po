"Headers and footers use their own formatting language. This is fully "
"supported when writing them but, due to the complexity and the "
"possibility of nesting, only partially when reading them. There is "
"support for the font, size and color for a left, centre/center, or right "
"element. Granular control (highlighting individuals words) will require "
"applying control codes manually."
